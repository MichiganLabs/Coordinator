// Ok, so we're gonna take ownership of this file...
// Changelog:
//  LOA-793 (~8/1/20, sara):
//   Added Resolver to Common
//   Adjusted conditional import statements - avoid swiftUI import & related code unless swiftUI available
//   Created ServiceIdentifier to replace bare strings for naming
//   Replaced NONAME -> ServiceIdentifier.none
//   Created ResolverFactoryArgumentsIdentifier - we can now pass the ServiceIdentifier
//      associated with the current service resolution to the resolved factory function
//   Also created ResolverFactoryMutatorArgumentsIdentifier, same thing but for the mutating factory function type
//   Set ServiceIdentifier.none for default parameter and made ServiceIdentifier params non-optional
//      (no functionality change - providing a nil name used to map to NONAME anyway)
//   Set default scoping to application (was graph) - this is most convenient for our purposes rn
//      Anything with persistent state throughout the app lifetime absolutely _must_ be application- or cache-scoped
//      Some other things should be app-scoped as well,
//          e.g. HostProviders, which are currently resolved by 
//      We should test what works best, performance-wise.
//
//   Swiftlint/code cleanup pass
//
//  [your stuff here]

//  TODO: at some point...
//  - This file is getting big; we can move some things (e.g. property wrappers) elsewhere
//  - allow resolution by name even when something wasn't registered by name
//  -- if a name is provided but doesn't match anything on the resolved type,
//  --  check if we have a ResolverFactory[Mutator]ArgumentsIdentifier for that type with no name.
//  --  if so, invoke that factory, using the name that the user wants to resolve, rather than no name.
